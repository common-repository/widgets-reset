== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why was this plugin created? =

When switching themes, widgets sometimes get "stuck" in the old theme's sidebars/widget areas.  This plugin allows you to quickly and easily reset your widgets.

= Will my widget information be saved? =

No.  No.  No.

I can't stress enough that this completely resets everything.  So, if you have some important information saved in something like a text widget, you better save it before resetting your widgets.

In short, don't complain if you reset your widgets and lose information that you have been told to save.
